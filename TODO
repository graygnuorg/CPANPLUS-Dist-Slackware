* Automatically remove the staging directory from /tmp/CPANPLUS after
  a package was built successfully.

* Make sure that system files like /bin/sh cannot be overwritten by malicious
  distributions.

* List the shared libraries that are used by XS modules in
  README.SLACKWARE.

* _summary_from_pod() does not return summaries for
  Class::C3::Componentised, Debug::ShowStuff WWW::Mechanize::TreeBuilder and
  possibly other modules.

* It seems that Alien::wxWidgets needs to be removed from the system before
  the package can be re-built.  Needs more investigation.

* The Clipboard distribution depends on xclip, which is available at
  slackbuilds.org.  The module's test suite fails if xclip is not installed.
