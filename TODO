* Test on slackware64.

* Most likely a bug in another module, but when running "cpan2dist --verbose
  --install Task::Kensho" the build failed on the first run (it succeeded on
 the second run) with the following output:

  Running [/usr/bin/perl5.14.2 /usr/bin/cpanp-run-perl \

* Make sure that system files like /bin/sh cannot be overwritten by malicious
  distributions.

* _summary_from_pod() does not return summaries for
  Class::C3::Componentised, Debug::ShowStuff WWW::Mechanize::TreeBuilder and
  possibly other modules.

* Automatically remove the staging directory from /tmp/CPANPLUS after
  the package was built successfully?

* List non-standard shared libraries that are used by XS modules in
  README.SLACKWARE?

* It seems that Alien::wxWidgets needs to be removed from the system before
  the package can be re-built.

* The Clipboard distribution depends on xclip, which is available at
  slackbuilds.org.
