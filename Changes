Revision history for CPANPLUS-Dist-Slackware

1.012  2013-06-08 09:07:15 CEST

- Call _perl_mb_opt() in _fake_install() instead of hardcoding path names.

1.011  2013-05-30 10:56:48 CEST

- Support Module::Build::Tiny by passing command-line options to 'Build
  install'.
- Respect the environment variable BUILD similar to the scripts from
  SlackBuilds.org.  As packages may be built recursively setting the build
  number is mainly useful when all packages are rebuilt after upgrading Perl.

1.010  2012-08-23 03:12:31 CEST

- Use three digit version numbers.  Use the same version number everywhere.
- The Padre plugin creates a doinst.sh file that runs update-desktop-database
  and gtk-update-icon-cache.
- The YAML::Syck plugin is no longer needed.
- Use CPAN mail address as contact address.

1.00  2012-02-13 09:48:12 CET

- List required packages instead of module names in README.SLACKWARE.
- Update the YAML::LibYAML plugin.  Add YAML::Syck plugin.  Fix errors that
  occur when these modules are built with the GCC compiler flag
  "-Werror=format-security".
- Add Convert::BinHex plugin, which fixes a bug in the module's test suite.
- Add Net::Pcap plugin, which fixes the module's Makefile.PL.

0.05  2012-02-01 19:31:33 CET

- Document the plugin interface.
- Add Padre plugin, which installs a desktop entry and an icon for Padre.
- Add Mail::SpamAssassin plugin, which installs an init script and additional
  documentation.
- Don't prepend "perl-" to module names like "perl-ldap" that already start
  with "perl-".

0.04  2012-01-24 07:25:41 CET

- Add plugins, which may be used to fix quirks or customize packages.

  available.

0.03  2012-01-18 14:51:26 CET

  package has been built successfully.
